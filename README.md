A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Currently Ranked top 8% on the global leaderboard, Completed over 600+ challenges and Push at least 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, before moving onto other challenges, I solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations
There are endless ways to solve a kata, I consistently review & refactor my solutions before and after I have solved them for optimization, efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned:
The biggest Lesson I learned is that there is always more that can be learned and improved upon. A good foundational knowledge of a language is the first step to mastery. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
